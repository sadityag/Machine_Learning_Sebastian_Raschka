    "A useful trick to avoid overloading the features extracted with words that don't hold much discrimantory information, such as 'and' and 'the' is known as term frequency inverse document frequency (tf-idf). This is the prodcut of the term frequency and the inverse document frequency. We have already seen the term frequency before: $tf(t, d)$ is the frequency that term $t$ appears in the document $d$ (exactly what was encoded above). For example, $tf($'plus', 'One plus one is two and two is one plus one'$) = 2$. The document frequency is the number of documents $d$ that contain the term $t$ and is denoted $df(t)$. In the example above, $df('and') = 2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "With a total of $n_d$ documents, the inverse document frequency is given by $$idf(t) = \\log \\frac{n_d}{1 + df(t)},$$ and the tf-idf is simply $$tf\\text{-}idf(t, d) = tf(t, d)\\times idf(t)$$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The tf-idf is used to weight the words, and clearly goes down for a word that appears a lot. Scikit-learn has a transformer for this. It also has a smoothing option, where $$idf(t) = \\log \\frac{1 + n_d}{1 + df(t)}$$ to assign an idf of 0 to words that appear in all documents. This also does $$tf\\text{-}idf(t, d) = tf(t, d)\\times (idf(t) + 1),$$ in order to prevent the weight from going to 0 completely.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is typical to normalize the feature vectors before the $tf\\text{-}idf$ weighting, but sklearn does this post fact.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an effort to understand the calculation it will undertake, let's take up a calculation ourselves. $$tf\\text{-}idf('the', d_2) = tf('the', 'jumps\\, over\\, the\\, lazy\\, dog') \\times (idf('the') + 1) = 1 \\times (1 + \\log \\frac{1 + 6}{1 + 5}) = 1 + \\log \\frac{7}{6}.$$ This takes the place of one index, in one feature vector. Once the entire feature vector is calculated thus, we normalize it."
