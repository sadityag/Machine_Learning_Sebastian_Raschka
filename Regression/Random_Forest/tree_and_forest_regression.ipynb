    "We start with decision trees. It works exactly the same way as with classification, splitting by information gain per feature, with entorpy as a criteria or Gini for classification. The choice of split is dictated by the maximal information gain, but for regression, the MSE is used. In this case, the MSE is known as the within-node variance. The splitting criteria is also known as variance reduction."
